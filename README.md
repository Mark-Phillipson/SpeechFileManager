# SpeechFileManager 

Searching for files using File Explorer and Speech Recognition can be quite challenging.

To this end I have created a Windows Forms C# application to improve file searching by Speech.

The user can Speak directly into the search box and view the results below. 
Once you see the file you require you can issue a Select <number> to open or select the file.
